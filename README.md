## Team Roles
In this project, each team member plays a critical role in ensuring the successful development and deployment of the Airbnb Clone. Below is an overview of the main roles and their responsibilities:
Backend Developer:
 Responsible for building and maintaining the server-side logic, creating API endpoints, implementing business logic, and ensuring data flows correctly between the database and the frontend.


Database Administrator (DBA):
 Designs and manages the database architecture, ensures data integrity, creates indexes for optimization, and maintains database performance and security.


DevOps Engineer:
 Handles deployment, monitoring, scaling, and CI/CD pipeline integration. Ensures the application runs smoothly in different environments and manages infrastructure using tools like Docker and GitHub Actions.


QA Engineer:
 Focuses on testing the application’s functionalities to guarantee reliability and quality. Writes automated tests, conducts manual testing, and ensures bugs are identified and resolved before release.


Project Manager / Team Lead (optional if applicable):
 Coordinates team efforts, manages timelines, organizes tasks, and ensures effective collaboration among all roles.

## 🛠 Technology Stack

This project integrates several modern technologies to replicate the functionality of Airbnb.  
Each technology has a specific role in building a scalable, secure, and efficient application.

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend logic, handle authentication, and create RESTful APIs.  
- **PostgreSQL / MySQL**: Relational database systems for managing and storing structured data such as users, listings, reservations, and reviews.  
- **GraphQL**: A query language and runtime that provides flexible and efficient data fetching, allowing clients to request only the data they need.  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Core web technologies for building the frontend user interface and ensuring an interactive experience.  
- **React (optional)**: A JavaScript library for creating reusable UI components and enhancing the user experience with a dynamic frontend.  
- **Docker**: A containerization tool used to standardize development environments and simplify application deployment.  
- **Git & GitHub**: Tools for version control, collaboration, and repository management.  
- **GitHub Actions (CI/CD)**: A continuous integration and continuous deployment service to automate testing and deployment pipelines.
