## 🎯 Project Goals
The main goals of this project are to:  
- 🏗 Recreate core functionalities of Airbnb (listings, reservations, authentication, user profiles).  
- 🌍 Provide a **realistic full-stack development experience**.  
- 🔐 Apply **best practices in API security** and data protection.  
- 🗄 Design and implement a **robust relational database** with MySQL.  
- 🤝 Strengthen **team collaboration** and **GitHub workflows**.  
- 🚀 Learn how to set up and use **CI/CD pipelines** for automated deployment.  
- 📑 Improve **documentation and project planning** for large-scale applications.  


## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python (Django / Flask)  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React optional)  
- **Database:** MySQL / PostgreSQL  
- **APIs:** REST, GraphQL  
- **DevOps Tools:** Docker, GitHub Actions (CI/CD)  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## Team Roles
In this project, each team member plays a critical role in ensuring the successful development and deployment of the Airbnb Clone. Below is an overview of the main roles and their responsibilities:
Backend Developer:
 Responsible for building and maintaining the server-side logic, creating API endpoints, implementing business logic, and ensuring data flows correctly between the database and the frontend.


Database Administrator (DBA):
 Designs and manages the database architecture, ensures data integrity, creates indexes for optimization, and maintains database performance and security.


DevOps Engineer:
 Handles deployment, monitoring, scaling, and CI/CD pipeline integration. Ensures the application runs smoothly in different environments and manages infrastructure using tools like Docker and GitHub Actions.


QA Engineer:
 Focuses on testing the application’s functionalities to guarantee reliability and quality. Writes automated tests, conducts manual testing, and ensures bugs are identified and resolved before release.


Project Manager / Team Lead (optional if applicable):
 Coordinates team efforts, manages timelines, organizes tasks, and ensures effective collaboration among all roles.

## 🛠 Technology Stack

This project integrates several modern technologies to replicate the functionality of Airbnb.  
Each technology has a specific role in building a scalable, secure, and efficient application.

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend logic, handle authentication, and create RESTful APIs.  
- **PostgreSQL / MySQL**: Relational database systems for managing and storing structured data such as users, listings, reservations, and reviews.  
- **GraphQL**: A query language and runtime that provides flexible and efficient data fetching, allowing clients to request only the data they need.  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Core web technologies for building the frontend user interface and ensuring an interactive experience.  
- **React (optional)**: A JavaScript library for creating reusable UI components and enhancing the user experience with a dynamic frontend.  
- **Docker**: A containerization tool used to standardize development environments and simplify application deployment.  
- **Git & GitHub**: Tools for version control, collaboration, and repository management.  
- **GitHub Actions (CI/CD)**: A continuous integration and continuous deployment service to automate testing and deployment pipelines.

## 🗄 Database Design

The database is designed to support the main features of the Airbnb Clone project.  
It uses a **relational model** to ensure data integrity and efficient queries.

### 🔑 Key Entities

#### 1. **Users**
Represents the people interacting with the platform (hosts and guests).
- **id** (Primary Key)  
- **name**  
- **email**  
- **password_hash**  
- **role** (e.g., host, guest)  

#### 2. **Properties**
Represents listings created by hosts.
- **id** (Primary Key)  
- **title**  
- **description**  
- **location**  
- **price_per_night**  
- **host_id** (Foreign Key → Users.id)  

#### 3. **Bookings**
Represents reservations made by users.
- **id** (Primary Key)  
- **user_id** (Foreign Key → Users.id)  
- **property_id** (Foreign Key → Properties.id)  
- **start_date**  
- **end_date**  
- **status** (e.g., pending, confirmed, cancelled)  

#### 4. **Reviews**
Represents feedback left by guests after a stay.
- **id** (Primary Key)  
- **user_id** (Foreign Key → Users.id)  
- **property_id** (Foreign Key → Properties.id)  
- **rating** (1–5)  
- **comment**  

#### 5. **Payments**
Represents transactions made for bookings.
- **id** (Primary Key)  
- **booking_id** (Foreign Key → Bookings.id)  
- **amount**  
- **payment_date**  
- **payment_method** (e.g., card, PayPal)  
- **status** (e.g., paid, pending, failed)  

---

### 🔗 Relationships
- A **User** can be a **host** (owns multiple properties) or a **guest** (makes bookings).  
- A **Property** belongs to one **User** (the host) but can have many **Bookings**.  
- A **Booking** is made by a **User** (guest) for one **Property**.  
- A **Review** is written by a **User** for a **Property** after a booking.  
- A **Payment** is linked to exactly one **Booking**.

👉 This structure ensures the application can handle user interactions, reservations, reviews, and payments in a scalable way.
