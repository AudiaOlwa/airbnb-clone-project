## 🗄 Database Design

The database is designed to support the main features of the Airbnb Clone project.  
It uses a **relational model** to ensure data integrity and efficient queries.

### 🔑 Key Entities

#### 1. **Users**
Represents the people interacting with the platform (hosts and guests).
- **id** (Primary Key)  
- **name**  
- **email**  
- **password_hash**  
- **role** (e.g., host, guest)  

#### 2. **Properties**
Represents listings created by hosts.
- **id** (Primary Key)  
- **title**  
- **description**  
- **location**  
- **price_per_night**  
- **host_id** (Foreign Key → Users.id)  

#### 3. **Bookings**
Represents reservations made by users.
- **id** (Primary Key)  
- **user_id** (Foreign Key → Users.id)  
- **property_id** (Foreign Key → Properties.id)  
- **start_date**  
- **end_date**  
- **status** (e.g., pending, confirmed, cancelled)  

#### 4. **Reviews**
Represents feedback left by guests after a stay.
- **id** (Primary Key)  
- **user_id** (Foreign Key → Users.id)  
- **property_id** (Foreign Key → Properties.id)  
- **rating** (1–5)  
- **comment**  

#### 5. **Payments**
Represents transactions made for bookings.
- **id** (Primary Key)  
- **booking_id** (Foreign Key → Bookings.id)  
- **amount**  
- **payment_date**  
- **payment_method** (e.g., card, PayPal)  
- **status** (e.g., paid, pending, failed)  

---

### 🔗 Relationships
- A **User** can be a **host** (owns multiple properties) or a **guest** (makes bookings).  
- A **Property** belongs to one **User** (the host) but can have many **Bookings**.  
- A **Booking** is made by a **User** (guest) for one **Property**.  
- A **Review** is written by a **User** for a **Property** after a booking.  
- A **Payment** is linked to exactly one **Booking**.

👉 This structure ensures the application can handle user interactions, reservations, reviews, and payments in a scalable way.


## ✨ Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone project includes several core features that replicate real-world booking platform functionality.  
Each feature plays a key role in delivering a seamless experience for both hosts and guests.  

### 1. **User Management**
Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.  
It allows individuals to sign up as hosts or guests, manage their profiles, and securely access the platform.  

### 2. **Property Management**
Enables hosts to create, update, and manage property listings.  
Each listing includes essential details such as title, description, price, location, and availability, making it easy for guests to explore options.  

### 3. **Booking System**
Provides guests with the ability to search and reserve properties for specific dates.  
It includes availability checks, booking confirmation, and status updates (e.g., pending, confirmed, cancelled).  

### 4. **Review System**
Allows guests to leave reviews and ratings for properties after their stay.  
This fosters trust and transparency, helping future guests make informed decisions while rewarding good hosts.  

### 5. **Payment Integration**
Processes payments for confirmed bookings securely.  
Supports multiple payment methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal) and tracks transaction history to ensure reliability and accountability.  

### 6. **Search & Filtering**
Enables users to search for properties by location, price range, date, or amenities.  
This improves the user experience by helping guests quickly find listings that meet their needs.  

### 7. **Security & API Protection**
Implements authentication, authorization, and data validation for all API endpoints.  
This ensures that sensitive information (e.g., user data and payment details) is handled securely.  


## 🔐 API Security

Security is a critical component of the Airbnb Clone project, ensuring that user data, transactions, and platform interactions remain safe.  
The following measures will be implemented to protect the system:  

### 1. **Authentication**
- Users must log in with secure credentials (username/email and password).  
- Tokens (e.g., JWT) will be used to verify user identity for each request.  
- **Why it matters:** Prevents unauthorized access and ensures only legitimate users can interact with the system.  

### 2. **Authorization**
- Role-based access control (RBAC) will determine what actions users can perform (e.g., only hosts can create properties, only guests can book).  
- **Why it matters:** Ensures users only perform actions relevant to their roles, protecting sensitive operations.  

### 3. **Data Validation & Input Sanitization**
- All incoming data will be validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other common vulnerabilities.  
- **Why it matters:** Protects the database and application logic from malicious inputs.  

### 4. **Rate Limiting**
- APIs will include request rate limits to prevent brute-force attacks and abuse of resources.  
- **Why it matters:** Protects against denial-of-service attacks and ensures fair use of the system.  

### 5. **Encryption**
- Sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information) will be encrypted in storage and transmitted over HTTPS.  
- **Why it matters:** Prevents data leaks and secures transactions against interception.  

### 6. **Secure Payments**
- Payment APIs will integrate with trusted third-party gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).  
- **Why it matters:** Ensures financial transactions are processed safely and user payment data is never exposed.  

### 7. **Logging & Monitoring**
- Security-related events (e.g., failed logins, unusual activity) will be logged and monitored.  
- **Why it matters:** Helps detect threats early and respond quickly to security breaches.

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
A **CI/CD pipeline** (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) is an automated process that helps developers build, test, and deploy applications more efficiently.  
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Ensures that new code changes are automatically tested and merged into the main branch without breaking the application.  
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Automatically delivers tested and verified code into production or staging environments.  

### Why it is Important for this Project
- 🚀 **Faster Development Cycles:** Automates repetitive tasks like testing and deployment, reducing manual effort.  
- 🛡️ **Higher Code Quality:** Every code change is validated with automated tests before merging.  
- 🔄 **Reliability:** Ensures consistent deployments, minimizing the risk of errors during production releases.  
- 🤝 **Team Collaboration:** Helps multiple developers work together smoothly by integrating changes seamlessly.  

### Tools to Use
- **GitHub Actions:** For automating testing, linting, and deployment directly from the GitHub repository.  
- **Docker:** For containerizing the application to ensure consistency across different environments.  
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL in Docker containers:** To provide reproducible database environments for testing and deployment.  
- **Optional Add-ons:** Tools like **Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean** for deployment.
